## Diet

- *Diet is more important than exercise.*

- __Fasting is the best way the lose body fat__,
  because you're using your body fat as your energy source.
  Cutting on carbs is less effective because eventually
  your metabolism adjusts itself and you can only go so far
  until you feel fatigued.
- Besides losing body fat, short-term fasting (less than 24 hours)
  increases growth hormone, lowers insulin and blood sugar levels,
  improves mental clarity, is good for disease prevention,
  has short-term autophagy benefits, among other things.
  13 hours per day is considered the optimal amount.
- Long-term fasting (more than 48 hours), besides the short-term benefits,
  to put it simply, detoxes/resets the body. Beware though, if you fast too long
  (more than 3 days I'm guessing), you could lose some muscle.
  Benefits include: reduced inflammation, reduced age-related diseases, autoimmunity reset, etc.
  [More info](https://prolonfmd.com/fasting-mimicking-diet/).
- Note that __fasting is only consuming water and nothing else__.
  You could have tea and black coffee, among other things,
  but then you lose some of the benefits.
  [More info](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).

- __Do not overeat, ever__, you're only going to gain body fat.
- __Drink enough water__, if you're thirsty, it's already too late.
- You can eat fat, it doesn't necessarily make you fatter,
  that is, if it are healthy fats.
  Healthy fats are:
  saturated <small>(coconut oil, grass-fed butter)</small> and
  polyunsaturated <small>(omega-3 and 6)</small>.
- Simple and white carbohydrates are the most unhealthy forms of carbs,
  i.e. not nutritious.  
  <small>All forms of sugar, white bread, white pasta, etc.</small>.
- Complex carbohydrates are the most healthy form of carbs,
  i.e. most nutritious.  
  <small>Green vegetables, beans, lentils, sweet potatoes, whole grains, etc.</small>


### Additional info

- Good for the gut: soluble fiber, fermented foods, kombucha.
- Carbs can best be eaten early in the day (you're more insulin resistant later in the day).
- Eating less frequent helps with reducing insulin resistance.
- Keep at least 20 minutes between meal portions.
- Don't think about your BMI, it's not relevant.
- Creatine is the only "good" supplement for muscle growth.
- Gluten-free products are sometimes worse than products with gluten:
  a lot of chemicals, corn syrup, etc.
- Your mood determines a good amount of how you process food/drinks.


### Detailed info

- Vitamin D <small>(UV radiation, sun)</small> and magnesium <small>(dark green vegetables,
  kale leaves, spinach, etc.)</small> are probably the most important micronutrients.
- Sugar <small>(50% glucose, 50% fructose)</small> is the main reason for obesity.
- Don't eat too much fruit with a high fructose level <small>(max 1-2/day)</small>.
- Low-fat food usually means high sucrose levels, so avoid those.
- A ketogenic state means that the body will retrieve energy from your stored fat,
  instead of glucose (sugars, carbs, etc.).
- A good diet and fasting are the best ways to prevent cancer.
- Supplement sodium (salt) and magnesium when feeling weak/dizzy while exercising.
- Vitamin A is good for the eyes.




## Exercise

- __Heavy weights & less reps are better than lighter weights & more reps.__
  Mainly because it makes you stronger and it causes more fat loss
  (up to 3 days after training).
- 8 to 12 sets of 4 to 6 reps, seems to work best.
- Make sure to get enough rest, train every muscle group once per week.
  It can take 3 to 7 days to fully recover from a heavy-weight workout.
- You can train your abs/core and calves multiple times per week,
  as they take less time to recover (smaller muscles).
- Train your grip and core for better overall strength.
- Cardio isn't necessary, but it can help you build and retain more muscle.
  [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/cardio-and-muscle-growth-friends-or-foes/).
- When you do cardio, prefer
  [HIIT](http://www.muscleforlife.com/high-intensity-interval-training-and-weight-loss/)
  (High-Intensity Interval Training) over other methods.


### Additional info

- Before meals,
  you can do some light exercises <small>(like wall-pushes and squats)</small>
  to ensure that those muscles get fed
  <small>(also an hour and a half after the meal)</small>.
- Relating to rest between sets, rest until your breath has somewhat
  returned to normal. Not too long though. Roughly, 3-4 minutes for
  large muscle groups (eg. legs) and 1 minute for smaller muscle groups
  (eg. biceps).


### Detailed info

- When you are moving, your brain suppresses the pain signals.
  That's why sometimes you feel more pain after waking up the next morning.
  Your body received the full load, because you stopped moving for that long.
- *HIIT cardio:* You need to get moving fast and long enough to make your breathing labored,
  and you need to hold that speed for a fair amount of time.




## Sleep

- __Sleep is crucial__.
- 7 hours of sleep is the minimum.
- You cannot sleep one day just a few hours and the next day sleep
  a few hours longer, it doesn't work that way.
- Your muscles grow when you sleep
  (and sleep deficiency leads to faster muscle loss).
- Going to bed at the same time and getting up
  at the same time every day is essential.
- No screens or bright lights a half hour,
  or ideally a bit more, before bed (blue light).


### Additional info

- The ideal sleeping temperature is 17°C.
- Not enough sleep makes you fatter.
- Not enough sleep causes a testosterone deficiency.
- Your bedroom should be as dark as possible and a bit cool.
- To reset your biorhythm to the optimal hours,
  get some sunlight early in the morning (ideally between 6 and 8AM).

## Stress & Lifestyle

- Mental stress ⟺ physical stress <small>(it's all related)</small>
- Stress isn't always a bad thing.  
  It's a signal that you're body is preparing for something.
- How you think about stress and how you act in general,
  determines the amount and nature of its physical effects.
- Enjoy the now, don't think too much about where you're going.
- Don't think about tomorrow, nothing bad is going to happen.


### Managing

- _[Wim Hof method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/):_
  breathing is required to resist the cold,
  when trying to resist the cold you burn brown fat,
  which in turn keeps your temperature up and produces huge amounts of energy.
  Breathing effectively is important for your focus, metabolism, stress, etc.
- Meditating 20 minutes a day can bring enormous benefits, e.g. reduce bad stress.
  Focus on breathing/air flow.
- Visualizing yourself doing a task can improve your actual ability to do it.

## Allergies

- Exercise, ie. physical activity, speeds up blood flow and
  this allows allergens to be moved quickly through the body
  and eliminated via the kidneys and skin.
- Or in other words, a lack of exercise results in a sluggish blood flow.
  Stagnant allergens gather in a fixed position, which begins to destroy
  the tissues around them. Constant movement of the allergens through
  the blood stream prevents these delicate tissues from becoming inflamed.
- People whose natural defense system is weakened due to an infection
  or other physical stressor are at increased risk of developing an allergy.
