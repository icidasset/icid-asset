Most of this is based upon the research of [Tim](http://fourhourbody.com/) [Ferriss](http://fourhourchef.com/), the work of [Peter Attia](http://eatingacademy.com/), the guys from [Muscle for Life](http://www.muscleforlife.com/) and the work of [Dr. Rhonda Patrick](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/). If you see something that isn't quite right or you know something I could add to this list, please send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icidasset).




## Diet

- __Diet is more important than exercise.__
- How much you should eat depends on your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure),
  which in turn is based on your BMR (basal metabolic rate) and your activity level.
  [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/healthy-meal-planning-tips/).
- If you want to lose body fat, fast for more than nine hours.
  From that point on your body will use the stored fat
  as its energy source. Fasting does not cause muscle loss.
  <small>(more on fasting later)</small>
- If you want to gain muscle, eat 5-10% more than recommended.
  Try not to eat more than this, or you will gain too much body fat.
  <small>(Only effective if training properly, see workout schedule)</small>
- Do __not__ overeat, ever, you're only going to gain body fat.
- Drink enough water, if you're thirsty, it's already too late.
  Two to three liters per day should be good.
  Helps with losing body fat.
- Pre and post-workout meals are helpful if you want to gain muscle.
  <small>More info below.</small>
- You can eat fat, it doesn't make you fatter,
  that is, if it are healthy fats.
  Healthy fats are:
  saturated <small>(coconut oil, grassfed butter)</small> and
  polyunsaturated <small>(omega-3 and 6)</small>.
- Simple and white carbohydrates are the most unhealthy forms of carbs,
  i.e. not nutritious.  
  <small>All forms of sugar, white bread, white pasta, etc.</small>.
- Complex carbohydrates are the most healthy form of carbs,
  i.e. most nutritious.  
  <small>Green vegetables, beans, lentils, sweet potatoes, whole grains, etc.</small>
- Fasting 13 hours per day is considered the optimal amount of fasting.
  Fasting is good for disease prevention, better sleep, more energy.
  Note that fasting is __only consuming water and nothing else__. [More info](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).
- [Intermittent fasting](http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting)
  is a great pattern for eating
  to increase muscle mass and to decrease body fat.
  It might also help with increasing testosterone.


### Pre and post-workout meals

Pre:

- Pre-workout meals are useful for
  (1) building muscle by eating protein,
  and (2) improving performance by eating carbs.
- A small carbs/protein meal, 30-40gr protein, 40-50gr carbs.
- [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/pre-workout-nutrition/).

Post:

- Post-workout meals are useful for
  preventing muscle breakdown, and thus stimulating
  muscle growth.
- 30-50gr of protein and about 30% of your daily carbs.
- More activity = more protein.
- [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/guide-to-post-workout-nutrition/)


### Extra information

- Good for the gut: Fermented foods, Kombucha.
- Carbs can best be eaten early in the day (you're more insulin sensitive later in the day).
- Meal frequency doesn't matter.
- Keep at least 20 minutes between meal portions.
- Don't think about your BMI, it's not relevant.
- Creatine is the only "good" supplement for muscle growth.
- Gluten-free products are sometimes worse than products with gluten:
  a lot of chemicals, corn syrup, etc.
- Your mood determines a good amount of how you process food/drinks.


### Detailed information

- Vitamin D <small>(UV radiation, sun)</small> and magnesium <small>(dark green vegetables,
  kale leaves, spinach, etc.)</small> are probably the most important micronutrients.
- Sugar <small>(50% glucose, 50% fructose)</small> is the main reason for obesity.
- Don't eat too much fruit with a high fructose level <small>(max 1-2/day)</small>.
- Low fat food mostly means high sucrose levels, so avoid those.
- A ketogenic state means that the body will retrieve energy from your stored fat,
  instead of glucose (sugars, carbs, etc.).
- A good diet and fasting are the best ways to prevent cancer.
- Supplement sodium (salt) and magnesium when feeling weak/dizzy while exercising.
- Vitamin A is good for the eyes.




## Exercise

- __Heavy weights & less reps are better than lighter weights & more reps.__
  Mainly because it makes you stronger and it causes more fat loss
  (up to 3 days after training).
- 8 to 12 sets of 4 to 6 reps, seems to work best.
- Make sure to get enough rest, train every muscle group once per week.
  It can take 3 to 7 days to fully recover from a heavy-weight workout.
- You can train your abs/core and calves multiple times per week,
  as they take less time to recover (smaller muscles).
- Train your grip and core for better overall strength.
- Cardio isn't necessary, but it can help you build and retain more muscle.
  [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/cardio-and-muscle-growth-friends-or-foes/).
- When you do cardio, prefer
  [HIIT](http://www.muscleforlife.com/high-intensity-interval-training-and-weight-loss/)
  (High-Intensity Interval Training) over other methods.


### Extra information

- Before meals, not pre and post-workout meals,
  you can do some light exercises <small>(like wall-pushes and squats)</small>
  to ensure that those muscles get fed
  <small>(also an hour and a half after the meal)</small>.
- Relating to rest between sets, rest until your breath has somewhat
  returned to normal. Not too long though. Roughly, 3-4 minutes for
  large muscle groups (eg. legs) and 1 minute for smaller muscle groups
  (eg. biceps).


### Detailed information

- When you are moving, your brain suppresses the pain signals.
  That's why sometimes you feel more pain after waking up the next morning.
  Your body received the full load, because you stopped moving for that long.
- *HIIT cardio:* You need to get moving fast and long enough to make your breathing labored,
  and you need to hold that speed for a fair amount of time.




## Testosterone

Testosterone is another important factor.  
Testosterone can be increased in the following ways:

- More active = more testosterone.
- Use a lot of muscle groups while exercising (compound movements).
- Get enough sleep.
- Get enough vitamin D.
- Get rid of sugar (kills 25%).
- Making sure your selenium levels are in order.




## Allergies

- Exercise, ie. physical activity, speeds up blood flow and
  this allows allergens to be moved quickly through the body
  and eliminated via the kidneys and skin.
- Or in other words, a lack of exercise results in a sluggish blood flow.
  Stagnant allergens gather in a fixed position, which begins to destroy
  the tissues around them. Constant movement of the allergens through
  the blood stream prevents these delicate tissues from becoming inflamed.
- People whose natural defense system is weakened due to an infection
  or other physical stressor are at increased risk of developing an allergy.




## Sleep

- Sleep is every important, don't listen to the people
  that say that sleep is a waste of time.
- 7 and half hours of sleep is the absolute minimum.
- Not enough sleep makes you fatter.
- Not enough sleep causes a testosterone deficiency.
- Your muscles grow when you sleep
  (and sleep deficiency leads to faster muscle loss).
- You cannot sleep one day just a few hours and the next day sleep
  a few hours longer, it does not work like that.
- Going to bed at the same time and getting up
  at the same time every day is essential.
- Your bedroom should be as dark as possible and a bit cool.
- No screens or bright lights a half hour before bed.




## Stress & Lifestyle

- _[Wim Hof method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/):_
  breathing is required to resist the cold,
  when trying to resist the cold you burn brown fat,
  which in turn keeps your temperature up and produces huge amounts of energy.
- Visualizing yourself doing a task can improve your actual ability to do it.
  [More info](http://www.muscleforlife.com/how-to-get-stronger/).
- Do not think stress is something bad.
  It's a signal that you're body is preparing for something.
- How you think about stress and how you act in general,
  determines the amount and nature of its physical effects.
- Enjoy the now, don't think to much about where you're going.
- Don't think about tomorrow, nothing bad is going to happen.
- Breathing effectively is important for your focus, metabolism, stress, etc.
  â€“> __Wim Hof method.__
- Meditating 20 minutes a day can bring enormous benefits, e.g. reduce bad stress.
  Focus on breathing/air flow.
- Mental stress <=> physical stress <small>(it's all related)</small>
