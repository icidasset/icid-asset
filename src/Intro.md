I'm a programmer living in Ghent, Belgium, who works for a company based in Victoria, Canada, named [MetaLab](https://metalab.co/). I love great [music](https://soundcloud.com/purplesynth/likes), [books](books/) and [quotes](http://quotes.icidasset.com/). I also dabble in [electrical engineering](http://circuits.icidasset.com/).
